This is my first full-scale dynamic web application. 

I coded 100% of this project from scratch using the Flask framework. 

This web application allows users to make an account, login, and make posts. 

I used SQLALCHEMY to persist the data to a mySQL database. 

Post update and delete function is authorized by author, passwords are hashed and salted to improve security.
